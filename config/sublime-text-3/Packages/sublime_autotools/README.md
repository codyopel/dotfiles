Sublime Autotools
=================

**Autotools syntax highlighting for Sublime Text**

This package includes syntax highlighting for Autoconf M4 and Automake files.
It also provides improved syntax highlighting for Makefiles, called Makefile2.

If you want Makefile2 to override Sublime's default syntax highlighting for Makefiles, you can add this to `Makefile.sublime-settings` in your user settings directory:

```json
{
    "extensions": []
}
```
